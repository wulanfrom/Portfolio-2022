                <p>There has been a growing interest in explainable AI (XAI) to help users understand machine learning models by presenting comprehensive explanations as to why the model produced a prediction result. Various materials for learning have been designed to teach XAI, such as lecture videos, written materials, and interactive tutorials. Since explanations are often presented to users through user interfaces, it is important for learners to have a comprehensive understanding of how to design usable interfaces that present explanations to users. However, most of learning materials focus on algorithms for generating explanations or discussion of ethical perspectives of explanations, which do not directly inform how to design usable explanations.</p>
                <p>We introduce XDesign, an interactive platform that guides learners to go through a design process of creating usable explanations, where learners (1) implement the LIME explainer that presents explanations of image classification results, (2) generate and observe explanations for various input images, (3) discuss the usability of explanations based on their observations, and (4) design a user interface prototype that could overcome the limitations observed. We have iterated XDesign over two semesters in a human-AI interaction course offered to a total of 44 students, asking students to submit their implementations, discussions, and UI prototypes using XDesign in an assignment. Results show that students were able to identify concrete user needs through their exploration, highlight user tasks to support the needs, and design a user interface that aids the tasks.</p>
