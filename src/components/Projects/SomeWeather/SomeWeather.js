              <p>Climate change has been a major concern the past several years due to the change in lifestyles. There have been many activism and movements to bring about greener change, however, besides the main audience of activists, it is quite hard to convince people who are neutral about the environment to understand the severity of the problem and start a greener lifestyle due to the lack of impact and amount of effort needed. Climate change is mainly felt through the abnormal changes in the weather, which could be noticed through weather apps. From this, our team concluded that weather app could work as the first messenger for people to notice these abnormal changes in the environment. Which is why a weather app could play a role in notifying users of environmental issues and introducing them to possible ways to contribute. <b>So how might we create a weather app that helps users integrate decisions that help the environment into their everyday lives?</b></p>

                <p>This was my first time working with a group of designers, so it was challenging to come to a final concrete style for our app since everyone had differing design styles. The division of work was also important in order to play into the strengths of each member. I learned especially on how to take into account other’s opinions and reach a group agreement. I think it’s important for the group to believe in what we are all working on. Thank you to Professor Sangsu Lee for the mentoring throughout the project and my teammates for helping me grow as a designer and listener.</p>
